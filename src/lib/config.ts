NOTICE
The Real Estate Law requires that I provide you with a written consumer notice that describes the various business relationship choices that you may have with a real estate licensee. Since we are discussing real estate without you having the benefit of the Consumer Notice, I have the duty to advise you that any information you give me at this time is not considered to be confidential, and any information you give me will not be considered confidential unless and until you and I enter into a business relationship. At our first meeting I will provide you with a written consumer notice which explains those business relationships and my corresponding duties to you.

WIRE FRAUD ALERT: As your realty services provider, I will NEVER send you wiring instructions. Before wiring any money, call the intended recipient at a number that you know is valid to confirm the instructions. Do not hesitate to contact me if you need assistance with verification.
