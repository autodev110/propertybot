    "body": "Hi Dan Nik,\n\nFollowing up on your request, here are a few properties in 08003 that have been on the market for a while, potentially offering room for negotiation, and aiming to be among the 'nicest' in the area.\n\nProperty 1: 800 Marlowe Rd, Cherry Hill, NJ, 08003\nPrice: $599,900, 4 beds, 3 baths, 2056 sqft. \nThis property stands out due to its significantly longer time on the market. While it may not be the largest or most expensive, it offers a balance of size and negotiability.\n\nProperty 2: 22 Country Walk, Cherry Hill, NJ, 08003\nPrice: $730,000, 4 beds, 3 baths, 2693 sqft.\nThis property offers considerable square footage and has also been on the market for a while, suggesting potential for negotiation. It fits the client's location preference but may not be the 'nicest' option.\n\nProperty 3: 1869 W Point Dr, Cherry Hill, NJ, 08003\nPrice: $609,900, 4 beds, 3 baths, 2337 sqft.\nThis property also offers a decent number of days on the market and meets the bed count criteria.
